#### Illustrations
+ Titles
Add "H1" to "H6" hints before titles. 
When mouse is hovering the title, it works. This function makes me handy in writing some markdown files with complex structures, so I add it.

#### Acknowledgements
The idea of customizing more checkbox styles was inspired by [Minimal Theme(by @kepano)](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal);
Some icons of checkbox were copied from [Thing Theme(by @colineckert)](https://github.com/colineckert/obsidian-things);

#### Others
I made this theme for my personal use at first,  most of the color settings or matches were transplanted from my other app settings. I had been accustomed to them, for keeping consistent, I didn't add other customized styles or color setting functions to it, and it only worked well in Dark color scheme. Maybe, some other plugins could customize color-settings, I haven't tried or tested. Or, you could rewrite the `.css` file based on your favorite. 
Rewriting, Copying the source codes of the theme is free, and granted.
Actually, I just began to use Obsidian recently. I was making this theme while using and exploring the app, so I had not even tried more fuctions or plugins of Obsidian. Maybe, bugs or invalid forms could be occured in some cases. I would maintain and add some new settings to it in the course of future use.

Hope U Enjoy It!
